L3 F-TOUCH Design
===================

L3 F-TOUCH sensor is an enhanced version of the GelSight sensor, it acquires a much better three-axis force sensing capability while being ***L***ight-weight, ***L***ow-cost and wire***L***ess for the ease of replication and deployment.

This repository contains the documentation and manufacturing files for L3 F-TOUCH tactile sensor.
