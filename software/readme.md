* For the Tactile Mode, you can use any vision-based tactile sensor (VBTS) technique, for instance, GelSight, GelSlim etc.
* For the Force Mode, you can also use any AR tag. Here we use ArUco marker and collected the groundtruth data from the ATI F/T sensor and the L3-FTOUCH sensor data using the setup using above. Please make sure that the two data are synchronized and a multiple linear regression (MLR) model can be applied to obtain the calibration matrix of the sensor. The predicted data is presented in XXX, the overall output file is in XXX.
